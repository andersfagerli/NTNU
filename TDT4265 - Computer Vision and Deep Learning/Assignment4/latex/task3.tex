\subsection*{Task 3}

\subsubsection*{a)}

The filtering operation is called \textbf{non-maximum suppression} (nms).

\subsubsection*{b)}

\textbf{False}, predictions from deeper layers detect larger objects.

\subsubsection*{c)}

Different aspect ratios are used to detect objects of varying shape, as the different classes often have different shapes, giving faster and more stable convergence towards the final prediction boxes.

\subsubsection*{d)}

The main difference between SSD and YOLO is that SSD uses multi-scale feature maps for detection, while YOLO uses a single scale feature map.

\subsubsection*{e)}

We place 6 anchors for each pixel in the $38\times38$ feature map, giving $38\cdot38\cdot6=8664$ anchor boxes in total for this feature map.

\subsubsection*{f)}

For the entire network we have $6\cdot(38\cdot38 + 19\cdot19 + 10\cdot10 + 5\cdot5 + 3\cdot3 + 1\cdot1)=11640$ anchor boxes.
